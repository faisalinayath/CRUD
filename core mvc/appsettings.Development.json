//In .NET applications, "appsettings.json" is a configuration file that is used to store application settings and values.
//This file can be used to store a wide range of settings, including database connection strings, API keys, logging settings, and more.
//The file is typically located in the root directory of the application, and it uses JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) syntax to define
//key-value pairs for each setting.
